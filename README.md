# Collision_Cpp
learning C++, simple collision detection between two objects and controls

## notes
Maintaining this account to show learning progression, i'll will comment a few thoughts about what I've learned 
C++ is easier than i thought it would be, there is a bit of an annoyance with the necessity of the semicolon that many other languages does not pocess, but it's easily circumvented by other means.
Can't wait to start a Godot course after i finish this one, to be honest
